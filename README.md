# GUIDE FOR LITTLE ONES ONLY FOR 6.6ver. x64/x86 CRACK
- FIRST VIDEO GUIDE https://youtu.be/JovXbTjLo7w?si=7h8hVmr_YpCuj4OK
- SECOND VIDEO GUIDE(FOR NOOBS) https://youtu.be/tFF5TPHk_OQ?si=2setqKzMU0tXeCPd

# TEXT GUIDE 
1. Extract the files from the archive to the folder with reWASD
2. Change 4 paths in the file "1337_NI66A_PUSSYSLAYER_BREAKPOINT.xml". 
"C:\Program Files\reWASD\reWASDEngine.exe" to your path
3. Launch dnSpy.exe and drop reWASDEngine.exe into dnSpy
4. Add breapoint window in dnSpy ->Debug->Windows->Breakpoints
5. Import "1337_NI66A_PUSSYSLAYER_BREAKPOINT.xml" with special button in breapoint window
6. You should see 4 breakpoints, if there are less than 4 then you have done something wrong.
7. Launch reWASDEngine.exe(not reWASD.exe) only from dnSpy!!!!
8. Close reWASD only from tray windows and then close dnSpy

# Applying config and nothing happens? 6.6 ver.
FIRSTLY, CHECK CLOSED ISSUES AND TWO VIDEO GUIDES, BEFORE CREATING NEW, TAKE CARE OF YOUR AND MY TIME❤️

Most likely, you have not imported breakpoints
- There may be two reasons why they are not imported:
1. You need to select the current assembly in dnSpy, that is, click on reWASDEngine in Assembly editor, I did it in the video at 2:15.
2. Change the paths to the file reWASDEngine.exe in the file with breakpoints (1337_pus...xml), there are only 4 lines where you need to set the correct path to the file, in the video it is 1:46 minute (also in the video there is only 1 path because today the fix came out and now there are 4)
