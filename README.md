# NOTICE 18.12.2023
- Crack for 6.6 ver ready with youtube guide for those who really wants it, check releases. Version 7.0 crack will be later.
- May this holiday season brighten you up with happiness, joy and good cheer!

# Applying config and nothing happens? 6.6 ver.
Firtly, check closed issues, before creating new, Take care of your and my time❤️
Most likely, you have not imported breakpoints

- There may be two reasons why they are not imported:
1. You need to select the current assembly in dnSpy, that is, click on reWASDEngine in Assembly editor, I did it in the video at 2:15.
2. Change the paths to the file reWASDEngine.exe in the file with breakpoints (1337_pus...xml), there are only 4 lines where you need to set the correct path to the file, in the video it is 1:46 minute (also in the video there is only 1 path because today the fix came out and now there are 4)
